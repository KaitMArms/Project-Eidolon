        You sign the waiver and make your way into the next room. 2 women sit at desks on opposite sides of the room. Both are sitting and typing out something on a keyboard with monitor screens you cannot see. In front of you is a desk with 2 buttons, one on the left side of the table and the other on the right, just like the woman. 
        <br> The woman on the left notices your entrance immediately, looking up and waving. Her desk and outfit are immaculately pristine with not a single thing out of place, and her lightning blue eyes stare at you from behind her work before she continues typing away. 
        <br>The woman on the right takes a minute to respond seemingly engulfed in her work. Her desk is less organized with sticky notes everywhere and a lipstick-stained coffee cup next to her. She waves at you and smiles with slightly smudged lipstick. 
        <br>Over the intercom the robotic voice chimes in,  
        <br><pre>       “Which is real: left or right? After you select your choice please continue to the next room.”  </pre>   
    </p>

        Which button do you press,<!--<a href="page4.html"> the left</a> or <a href="page5.html">the right</a>-->
