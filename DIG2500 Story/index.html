            Please note that all images and voices put through any AI software for the purposes of this project were my own. No one else's work or likeness was used for the purposes of this project. In addition to this, the class that this was made for did not require JS. Any JS used was self taught through libraries and tutorials for portfolio sake. Enjoy!
