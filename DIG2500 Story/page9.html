        <!--<em>Increment wrong answer counter.</em>-->
        <br>As you press the left button you hear a click as the door opens, but something feels....... off.  “This isn’t...... What is going on? This doesn’t feel right” you say in panic as whatever is on the intercom line chimes in, 
        <br><pre>       “Well how did you feel before? Do you even know?........ Do you know how to feel?”</pre>
        <br>As you sit and think about it, you don’t remember the reason you were here. You can’t recall what you were feeling before now. Maybe everything is okay then! By the time you get out of your head you realize the lights have turned back on though you don’t remember when that happened. You gradually make your way into the next room where you see that it is empty aside from the same button set up as the previous tests and a square metal wall in front of you. It is dead silence for a few moments until the voice over the intercom states, 
        <br><pre>       “In a moment the metal divider in front of you will be lowered revealing a dress. This dress will phase between the colors red and blue. 
        You must select which color is the actual color of the dress. After you have determined which is the color, select the button with that chosen color,” </pre>
        <br>There is a pause before the metal divider revealing a simple dress that immediately starts fading in the following pattern 
        <br><pre>       <em>-red-blue-red-red-blue-blue-red-blue-blue-</em></pre>
        <br>Before pausing and repeating. Behind this dress is the closed door to the next room.
