        <br>As you press the right button, the power flashes and goes out. In the dark it is so quiet you can hear your heartbeat, a mechanical sound like ungreased pistons joining the rhythm in what feels like an eternity for the lights to come back on. Eventually, the power comes back on as a distance generator roars to life and the voice on the intercom reiterates like a broken machine glitching like a short-circuiting software as it states, 
        <br><pre>       “Please move to the fourth phase of the test”</pre>
        <br>In this room you see an empty room with the same button set up as the previous tests and a square metal wall in front of you as the voice over the intercom states,  
        <br><pre>       “In a moment the metal divider in front of you will be lowered revealing a dress. This dress will phase between the colors red and blue. 
        You must select which color is the actual color of the dress. After you have determined which is the color, select the button with that chosen color,” </pre>
        <br>There is a pause before the metal divider revealing a simple dress that immediately starts fading in the following pattern 
        <br><br><pre>       <em>-red-blue-red-red-blue-blue-red-blue-blue-</em></pre>
        <br>Before pausing and repeating. Behind this dress is the closed door to the next room.
