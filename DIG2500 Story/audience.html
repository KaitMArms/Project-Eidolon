                This chose your own adventure is a psychological horror that explores the blurring line between what is and is not Artifical Intelligence. While there is nothing gruesome or gory is within, it does contain existential questions, depersonalization, and derealization. If you have every had an issue with this type of story or have dealt with severe depression, schizphrenia, or disorders where those themes can make symptoms worst please read with caution. Your mental health is important and no story is worth hurting it. In addition to this warning, the national crisis line is <strong>988</strong>, and while I pray no one reading this every needs to call this number I would rather include it then not.

It is for those who like to have existence questioned and those who like to consider the ramifications of techonology as it advances.
