       As you press the button, you look over at the white bunny. Is it frowning? No matter. As the door clicks open and the entity behind the microphone directs, 
       <br><pre>       “Please, go through the door”</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
       <br>As you hurry through the door you see your prize on the table in front of you. Wow that was easy. This money was definitely worth it you had to do almost nothing to get it! As you collect your prize the voice over the speaker states,
       <br><pre>       “Thank you for your time. We hope you will work with us again 
        in the future. Please make your way out of the building.”</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
       You leave with a slight feeling of unease, but hey free money! This is probably the best outcome that could have happened. What a weird place.....
