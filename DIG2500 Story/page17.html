        As you press the red button, you hear the door click and open. As the person over the intercom statically stammers out,
        <br><pre>       “Please continue to the final test. We appreciate your patience”</pre>
        <br>As the door beyond the dress clicks open, you walk into the next room and there are 2 small trampolines, one to the left and one to the right. On the right you see a small black bunny doing little horizontal hops and on the left a white bunny doing bigger vertical hops. Both look like they are bunnies having some fun as the entity questions over the intercom,
        <br><pre>       “Which is the unknowing AI bunny? Press the button of the bunny you believe is real”</pre>
