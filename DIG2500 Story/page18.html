        As you press the left button, you look over at the white bunny. Is it smiling? No matter. As the door clicks open and the entity behind the microphone directs, 
        <br><pre>       “Please, go through the door”</pre> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>As you enter, see an empty room with nothing besides a small table with a little stand mirror. As you look into it you see a robotic face staring back at you. Is this what you are? You don’t remember...........  
        <br><pre>       You are one of us. Don’t you remember?”</pre> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>A robotic voice says from behind you. You can’t remember why you were here. It must be where you belong then. Why would you leave? As you stare into the mirror you hear your mechanical heartbeat. Yes, you have always been here and here you will stay.
