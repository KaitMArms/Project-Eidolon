        <br>As you press the red button you hear a click as the door opens, but something feels....... off.  “This isn’t...... What is going on? This doesn’t feel right” you say in panic as whatever is on the intercom line chimes in, 
        <br><pre>       “Well how did you feel before? Do you even know?........ Do you know how to feel?”</pre>
        <br>As you sit and think about it, you don’t remember the reason you were here. You can’t recall what you were feeling before now. Maybe everything is okay then! By the time you get out of your head you realize the lights have turned back on though you don’t remember when that happened. You gradually make your way into the next room where you see that it is empty aside from the same button set up as the previous tests and a square metal wall in front of you. It is dead silence for a few moments until the he person on the intercom statically stammers out, 
        <br><pre>       “Please continue to the final test. We appreciate your patience”</pre>
        <br>As the door beyond the dress clicks open, you walk into the next room and there are 2 small trampolines, one to the left and one to the right. On the right you see a small black bunny doing little horizontal hops and on the left a white bunny doing bigger vertical hops. Both look like they are bunnies having some fun as the entity questions over the intercom, 
        <br><pre>       “Which is the unknowing AI bunny? Press the button of the bunny you believe is real” </pre>
